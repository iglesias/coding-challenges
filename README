This repository is created with the idea of bringing together some of the
problems I have managed to solve or I am working on from different coding
contests.

Some of the sources:

- KATTIS. Online judge driven by the CSC department at KTH. Anyone (not required 
account) can browse the problem statements in the following URL:

  https://kth.kattis.scrool.se/

To look for a problem just introduce the problem's id (the one I use to name the
files) in the search box at the top right corner of the page. You can also
browse all the problems on the section "Problems" at the top of the page.

- Hackercup 12. The famous contest run by facebook.

- Codeforces. Some solutions to problems proposed in the contests run by this
web plattform (www.codeforces.com). They are ordered by the number of the round
when they appeared.
